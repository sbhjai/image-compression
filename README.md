## Goal
To optimize images for quality and loading speed.

## Comparison
Focusing on comparing 72 DPI at 85% quality vs 96 DPI at 75% quality

## Understanding DPI and Quality
### DPI (Dots Per Inch)
Measures image resolution:
* **72 DPI**: Standard for web image
* **96 DPI**: Slightly higher resolution

### Quality
* **85% Quality**: Moderate compression, balance between quality and file size
* **75% Quality**: Compressed, smaller file size

## 72 DPI at 85% Quality
* **Advantages:**
  * Good Quality: Maintains high image quality with moderate compression
  * Smaller File Size: Faster loading times than 100% quality
* **Disadvantages:**
  * Lower Resolution: Slightly less detail compared to 96 DPI
    
## 96 DPI at 75% Quality
* **Advantages:**
  * Good Quality: Better details with higher DPI
  * File Size: Faster load times, less bandwidth usage

* **Disadvantages:**
  * Lower Resolution: More compression may cause noticeable reduction in quality

On the right:
* DPI: 72 DPI
* Quality: 85%
* Dimension: 1000 x 667 px
* File size: 148 KB

### The 96 DPI at 85% file size is ~ 40% smaller than 72 DPI at 85%


### Conclusion
The 96 DPI at the lower quality can have the same visual quality with the 72 DPI at higher quality with the smaller file size
